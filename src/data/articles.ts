    content: `Are you looking for a top-rated Lindy AI Certified Service Partner for your AI automation needs? Look no further! With **over a decade of experience** assisting some of the **world's leading information businesses & content creators**, I can help you streamline your business operations, making them faster, easier, more enjoyable, and more profitable.

**I actually have a funny story about Lindy AI.**

I first discovered Lindy AI Agents and Workflow Automation software in October 2024 through Ben's Bites. I remember joining their Slack channel and over the course of 6 months, seeing some incredibly famous business personas pop in there, asking technical questions about how to setup their own Lindies.

That confirmed my suspicion that Lindy was fully poised to explode & dominate the world of AI Agents.

So, when an opportunity opened up to join their team, I immediately threw my hat in the ring.

Flo, the founder of Lindy AI, loved my intro video, and invited me to one of the best interview processes I've ever experienced in my life.

I was blown away by the culture & work ethic of Lindy. In my technical interview I built a fully autonomous Real Estate Qualification Lindy that schedules home showings for clients, automatically, over a phone call - with no human intervention. 10/10 cool as heck. It quickly became clear that we were super aligned and there was a mutual good fit for the role.

However - at that point - **cruel fate intervened.**

It turned out that the role was fully in-person in their office in SF with no scope of work remotely (which I respect Flo for). And although I tossed and turned for several nights debating whether I should start the move to San Francisco - it turns out it's actually very hard to do that with a very young baby.

So, regretfully, we had to end the process there, but with a firm "never say never" and with an open loop of "maybe some day, in the future".

### That day is today.

In Feb 2025, I became a fully certified Lindy Service Partner.

I'm now ready to serve clients build out **powerful vertical AI Agents** for their business, to help them **save time, grow sales, and eliminate busy-work.**

My past client accounts include some of the largest content creators in the world like Clickfunnels, Jenna Kutcher, Dean Graziosi, Prince EA, Amy Porterfield, Selena Soo and many more *(including that one guy from Game of Thrones that you know that I'm not allowed to talk about)*.

    content: `## To Save 10+ Hours A Week

It seems almost impossible to keep up with AI developments nowadays. Every day there seems to be a new tool, or ChatGPT model or some new hyped up system.

But as a business owner, you just want to know -

How can I use all these new AI developments to actually help my business run better?

This guide answers that question.

I'm going to show you all the REAL AI & automation systems I've seen (or personally built) that have actually saved hundreds of hours of busywork, grown sales by hundreds of percent and dramatically reduced painful manual processes for business owners like yourself.

- Automatically answer or triage the majority of customer support tickets
- Email classification (bonus: draft replies)
- Meeting summaries and transcripts
- Extracting information from documents (data analysis, invoices, action items etc)
- Operations automation

## Automatically answering or triaging inbound customer questions

In my opinion, one of the strongest use cases of AI is the ability to judge & classify text. Newer models are uncannily good at this (Claude 3.5 and GPT4o specifically)

AI can read through a long block of text (along with attachments) and can reliably classify it into categories that you define.

Some categories that my clients find useful are:

**[Product Feedback]** Just a general comment about the product, no help needed

**[Non-urgent support question]** A lower priority ticket that can be deprioritized

**[Very high priority]** Someone on the team needs to jump in immediately and resolve this, every minute counts. This could be a critical failure in your software, or an angry customer.

**[Bubbled up hot lead/prospect]** This prospect is asking bottom of the funnel sales questions and is ready to purchase (Notify sales team immediately)

**[Spam/Pitch]** As a business owner you probably get a hundred of these each day. Flag them as unimportant or close them immediately.

### How to implement this:

No matter what system you're using to handle inbound customer questions, all you'd need to do is use an automation system like Zapier, Make or n8n to create a trigger that watches whenever a new customer support ticket comes through.

You'd then add an AI module to analyze the body of text they sent through with a classification prompt.

## Email classification (bonus: draft replies)

One of the most important commodities in your business is your own personal time.

I'm not sure how many hours you personally spend sorting through your work / personal inbox but for most of my clients it was an incredible amount of time each day - time that could have been spent working on other, more important things.

In fact, most of my clients used to get entirely defeated by email. I remember screen sharing with one of them who had his Gmail open. 100,000+ new emails. He had entirely given up on checking his inbox.

With AI, this is a solved problem.

All you need to do is spend 5 minutes just brainstorming what kind of emails are important to you and define a few (not more than 3-4) broad categories:

**[Flagged: Urgent]** These are critical work or personal emails that need urgent attention. This could also be emails addressed directly to you that need an action from your side.

**[Flagged: Non-Critical]** These emails might be important to read but aren't pressing. A quick glance through might be enough to get caught up to date.

**[Flagged: Junk/Spam]** Marketing newsletters, junk pitches, and plain, outright spam all go into this bin. Review this once a month and then hit delete.

**BONUS:** For the non-critical emails, use a "Draft Email" automation action to ask the AI to draft (not send!) an email on your behalf. It already has the context of the email and your criteria of what's important for you. That way, when you open your email inbox, there's a message drafted for you that's already 99% ready to go.

## Meeting summaries and transcripts

One of the best things to come out of this AI age are meeting transcribers. There are tools out there like Fathom, Otter and Krisp that can automatically sit in on a Google Meet or a Zoom meeting, listen to everything that happened, identify all the speakers and transcribe the entire meeting.

They're also able to summarize the entire meeting, distill key takeaways, identify action steps and create a list and summary of all the topics discussed in the meeting.

Simply sign up for your favorite service - from my experience both Fathom and Otter are the best.

## Extracting information from documents

One of my favorite uses of AI so far.

AI's ability to read and understand pictures and documents (and soon, audio and videos as well) has changed the game completely for online businesses.

Here are some of the most effective automations I've helped my clients setup:

- Snapping pictures of paper documents (like invoices or purchase orders) & automatically sending the data into spreadsheets or other software
- Being able to extract data from PDF files - or to distill insights or takeaways from huge PDF files
- Being able to upload a CSV file into AI and have it come up with a beautiful analytics dashboard

Example workflows:

- Take picture of contract > AI extracts information > Store in CRM & trigger action steps
- Take picture of credit card / bank statement / bill / invoice > Extract data > Send to Xero or accounting
- Take a picture of sticky note > AI converts data into an Apple Note > Sends information into Google Calendar with action items
- Upload all your training videos, documents, customer chat history into a knowledgebase > Let users ask questions and self-serve

## Operations automation

This one is a bit more nuanced, but in essence, it boils down to sitting down with a pen and paper and asking yourself about the most boring, manual or repetitive processes you follow as you go through your workday.

A question great at kickstarting introspection is "Considering your workload on a day to day basis, what is the most painful task that you perform?"

Keep a key eye out for processes like data entry, extended copy-pasting.

Ask key players in your org the same questions - especially high value employees whose time is valuable. Key people like sales staff or client managers or other people who should be focused on things like direct revenue generation or client delivery - these people should not be struggling with operations.

Once you've collected this data, use a platform like Zapier or Make to automate the tasks you've identified that have automation potential!`

    content: `### Or.. How To Explode Your Sales Copy Conversion Rate By 2x, 3x or even 10x... *Without* Hiring 6 Figure Copywriters, Expensive Copywriting Courses Or Performing 7,469 Split Tests

If you've been staying up nights worrying that your sales pages aren't converting enough... And you're selling high ticket programs (coaching, retainers, workshops) where you need good fit prospects to take you up on your offers...

Then I have a silver bullet for you...

When you put it into place:

- You'll capture more people who are "on the fence"
- Your conversion rate for sales calls will skyrocket
- Clients will never even blink at your rates
- You'll work with more positive, successful action-driven clients
- Your quality of life will drastically increase
- You'll stop "taking work to home" because your clients will respect your boundaries
- You'll be able to get your clients explosive results - and started getting even more testimonials and referral business

And this can all be done by *just changing a button on your sales page.*

And you could do it without spending 10,000 hours working on "funnels", email marketing sequences, advanced Facebook retargeting strategies, split test software or any one of those intimidating new fads that keep popping up.

In fact, the "trick" I'm going to talk about goes way beyond marketing technology. I'd go as far as to call it a psychological tactic that has stood the test of time even before sales copy was ever born.

Skeptical? Read on.

It's called "framing" and I'd like to teach it to you for free right now so that you can forever change your relationship with your prospects.

As entrepreneurs, it's easy to slip into scarcity mode and want to aggressively close every single prospect that enters your funnel.

We say yes to bad fit clients, blur our personal boundaries, offer unreasonable discounts and repel great clients with our neediness.

After working in the world of marketing for a decade, I identified a pattern that my most successful clients used that set them apart heads and shoulders above the rest. These were the clients that quickly scaled their products and services to 7 figures and beyond and their success looked magical to outsiders.

They shared a common trait: ***Their clients all had the belief that it was a privilege to be able to work with them.***

You see, through their positioning, language and branding, they always had their clients qualify themselves to them, and never the other way around.

They disqualified ruthlessly, made their prices known beforehand, spelled out exactly who they wanted to work with and more importantly delivered AMAZING results to the people they chose to work with.

The power dynamic that was always at play was:

"I'm extremely good at what I do, and I'm great at getting results for my clients. I have a very specific type of client that gets great results from working with me. I never work with bad fit prospects. My best prospects don't blink at what I charge - instead they realize that my fees are an investment they will get several times ROI on."

Colleges in the USA use this to great effect as well. They set a high bar to get their prospects (aspiring students) to qualify for them. You need a minimum score (SATs, GMAT, GRE etc) and then need to write a personal essay with a summary of your whole life to a random stranger just for the privilege of paying $200k to attend a university.

When you frame your offers this way, you create a very powerful power dynamic in your favor.

Psychologically, people appreciate things they have to work hard to get.

People don't appreciate things that just fall in their laps.

Looking back personally, what have you bought online that had the most impact on your life?

Was it the free PDF or $3 "tripwire" video?

Or was the $30,000 mastermind course, or personal coaching engagement?

*People don't appreciate things that cost them little or no effort to acquire.*

How can we leverage this knowledge?

**By prequalifying every single prospect that comes into your funnel.**

By using **intelligent, automatic qualification systems** that ask important questions to your prospects and ruthlessly disqualify bad fits.

It's shocking how many business owners know this on a logical level - and yet jump through insane mental hoops to try to close every single lead that comes their way.

What's your biggest takeaway from this? What can you insert into your funnels *right now* that can help you powerfully prequalify your prospects?`

    excerpt: 'A blueprint for how any business can attract, convert and retain paying customers without needing an MBA.',
    featured: false,
    content: `### A blueprint for how any business can attract, convert and retain paying customers without needing an MBA

A lot has been said about the perfect customer lifecycle. Many marketers push their blueprints as a plan that apparently any business on Earth can implement, and lo behold! They're suddenly turning over millions a month.

This blueprint is not prescriptive. It's not even something I created. All I did here was pattern recognition and reading insightful articles by successful business owners (not marketers) who were kind enough to document what worked for them. This was inspired by people & companies like Dane Maxwell, Ryan Deiss and Keap (formerly known as Infusionsoft).

A word of warning. It can be easy to skim an article like this, roll your eyes, and say "Yeah, I've read this before." Well, yeah. There's no rocket science here. Small business ownership doesn't require a degree. The psychology of humans hasn't changed in thousands of years.

So why do most businesses still get marketing wrong?

The answer is simple most of the times. They're too busy being stuck in their business to zoom out and realize that the answers are staring them in the face.

That's why hiring business consultants is so important. They help you see the forest for the trees, point out your blind spots, call you on your BS and remind you that 99% of success is just deciding a plan and sticking with it.

Essentially, if you're a business that sells something online, and want to be tremendously successful, all you have to handle are the following 3 parts of your business strategy:

## Acquire

In the acquire phase, you need to magnetically attract the right people into your sphere of influence. You do this by driving traffic to a resource that calls out their specific problem or their required desire and offer to give it away for free or a very low cost, in exchange for their contact details.

You need to capture their contact details, document where they came from & then segment them based on their interests.

The outcome of this process is a database full of leads who are very interested in who you are and what you offer. You've demonstrated your authority by showing that you understand their problems and you're now in the perfect position to continue to deliver value and add trust.

### Driving traffic (Traffic Sources)

From your customer avatar, you know where your customers spend most of their time online. Is this on Facebook? Instagram? Perhaps they're ardent Redittors? Maybe they're on Google, searching how to solve their problems?

Only you know.

Pick the most promising traffic sources from the list above and setup your ad accounts.

Traffic is easy. There are hundreds of traffic sources - even if the flavor of the day platforms like Tiktok or Snapchat might change or go away, your ideal clients are still out there.

### Grab Attention

The way to grab your ideal prospects' attention is very straightforward:

> Call out **what the ideal client wants, in a specific period of time** while **addressing objections**. Then offer **compelling free** (or very low cost) **content** on this desire.

This can be in the form of a free PDF report, or white-paper. It could be a video, or a full video course. It could be a webinar. Or downloadable audio recordings.

Marketers call this either a lead magnet or an ethical bribe.

Here are the attributes of the highest converting lead magnets:

- They solve an IMMEDIATE Need
- They are almost immediately actionable
- They are short, and to the point
- They are either free, or priced very low
- They under-promise but end up over-delivering
- They don't create information overwhelm

## Convert

***"People buy from people who they know, like and trust"***

Knowing that people buy from people they know, like and trust enables you to authentically put your message out there in the world, without fear of judgement.

And so starts the art & science of lead nurturing.

**KNOW:** Your prospects get to know you through the message in your lead magnet. You solve an immediate need for them and help them see a brighter tomorrow. In their mind, you are now the expert.

**LIKE:** When you speak to your prospects' pains, pleasures, hopes and dreams, you are speaking in their language. You are building rapport with them.

**TRUST:** The fastest way to trust is a track record & social proof. Customer testimonials, video snippets, case studies, performance graphs, solid specific numbers that prove your products and services positively impact the lives of your customers.

They now know, like and trust you. **This is the perfect time to introduce your core offering.**

### Call To Action & Close The Sale

Send traffic to a well crafted landing page or order form with well written copy that reinforces everything we've been talking about.

Talk to them about the bright, shiny tomorrow. Focus on where they are now, and compare it to how much better things will be when they buy.

(Hint, some people will need to be asked 6-7 times before they buy from you - so persistence and automation helps)

**Take their money!** Sometimes we get in our own way when closing a sale. Put an option to pay on your main website, email them with an order form link, diversify your payment options.

## Leverage, Ascension and Creating ROI

It's okay to have your funnel losing you money up until this point.

Read that again.

**It's okay to have your funnel losing you money up until this point.**

In this phase, we're going to use our already existing customers to maximize profit.

### Deliver Results

Deliver what you promised. Deliver it fast. Get them results.

Your job isn't done after the sale. I recommend every week after they purchase your product or service, ask them specifically, "Did you get a result you're happy with?"

### Upsell

This is the step that separates the average business from the powerlifters.

The elites simply offer more.

Offer more to your customer. This is how giants like Amazon and McDonald's make up for their thin profit margins. Offer more products to buy, offer high ticket items to buy, upsell and cross sell your customers.

### Ask For Referrals

The final part of the funnel is to leverage the parts of your funnel that work and have the people going through it encourage other people to fill the top of your funnel.

In other words - FLIP THE FUNNEL.

The more testimonials and case studies you accumulate, the more "automated" your selling process becomes - you are literally stepping out of the sales process.

## Putting It All Together

**Measure & Test** - You should have cold, hard numbers on every bit of your funnel. Conversions, dropoff rates, customer lifetime value, email open and click rates.

**Scale** - Once you are confident that you are creating an ROI on your funnel that you're happy with - SCALE. Put 10 times the number of people through your funnel.

**Automate** - Leverage system, process and automation to boost sales, save time and scale your business. Powerful CRM systems are doing this round the clock for millions of businesses.
